   <h1 class="about"> About Me</h1>
<p class="about-text">
     I'm <span id="name"> Nasir Iqbal</span>, a passionate <span id="undr-line">front-end web developer</span> with strong skills in <span id="undr-line">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</span> . I specialize in building clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites that bring ideas to life on the screen.  

Currently, I’m a dedicated student, working tirelessly towards my dream of becoming a <span id="dream"> Software engineer</span>. Technology fascinates me — from writing elegant code to creating interactive web experiences, I find joy in every step of the development process.

Apart from coding, I'm deeply connected to the world of <span id="undr-line">Mathematics</span>. I spend countless hours solving problems, exploring patterns, and sharpening my analytical thinking. My laptop is more than just a device — it’s my workshop, my classroom, and often, my best companion.

In my free time, I enjoy playing cricket, a sport that teaches me teamwork, patience, and strategy. I also have a deep appreciation for <span id="undr-line">Urdu literature</span>, which inspires my creativity and enhances my understanding of expression and language.
